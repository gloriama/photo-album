This is a simple vanilla React app, used for educational purposes.

## Set-up

1. Run ```bower install``` to install dependencies (React, jQuery, and lodash).
2. If you do not already have it installed on your computer, globally install live-server with ```sudo npm install -g live-server```. This will serve the pages from a server, which Babel needs to be able to transpile the ES6 used in this repo. Live-server also conveniently provides live reloading of the browser when files are updated.
3. Run ```live-server``` to start the server. This will automatically open index.html in the browser.
